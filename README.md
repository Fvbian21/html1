Hi, I'm Fabian ðŸ‘‹
I'm 22 years old and passionate about sports, including weightlifting, cycling, and running.

I've created this GitHub to document my journey from zero to becoming a Junior Python developer. Here, you'll find my projects, challenges, and progress as I learn and grow in the world of programming.

Join me on this adventure, and feel free to connect or share tips along the way! ðŸš€
